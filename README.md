## Overview

The project models and analyzes the following performance aspects of a turboprop aircraft:

- Thrust and power requirements
- Rate of climb and service ceiling
- Takeoff and landing performance
- Range and endurance (based on Breguet equations)
- Drag polar and fuel efficiency
- Payload-range tradeoffs
